 No wall charger? Seriously?

Flagship watch, $600 price tag and you can't include a simple wall charger? I don't think it's our of line to say that the vast majority of consumer usb wall chargers are not female usb c. It's almost like they're trying to be like apple? Watch seems great it of the box, but this charging cord thing bugs me.... luckily, I had a usb c to usb adapter to charge it, otherwise, I'd be spending more money.
